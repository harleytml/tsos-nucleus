This is TS/OS's Monolithic kernel

Current Version: `Neutronium (0.0)`

TS/OS is a SysV ABI operating system with a focus on being as multiplatform as possible.

TS/OS was a operating system made for several reasons

- 1: Because I got bored, and I had nothing to do
- 2: Because I needed to learn C/C++
- 3: Because I got infuriated by the fact that some devices cannot have Linux ports (like the GBA)
- 4: And finally, because I was inspired by the genius of Terry A. Davis.

I intend for TS/OS to be ported to everything. My first goal is all those handheld game consoles, mostly the little arm ones. If I can get it to run on a GBA, surely I can run it on the others.

The story behind TS/OS is a interesting one. The first edition was mostly developed on a hacked TI-Nspire, a graphing calculator. I got bored during the winter break of my sophomore year, and I always wanted to make a OS. So I did with a copy of The Revolutionary Guide To Assembly Language, and some random documents on the GBA.

I had just learned C++, and wanted to reinvent the wheel. I had a little too much time on my hands.

The TS/OS kernel is called the Nucleus. Many other chemistry analogues will be made in the OS. The TS/OS version of a kernel panic is a Nucleus Fission!

In the documents directory, you can find more documents concerning TS/OS.

## Current Platforms

Run

```sh
python3 ./build.py help
```

to see all the platforms

## Pre-Building

You need to install these tools:

```sh
clang-12
lld-12
llvm-12
termcolor
make
cmake
python3
pip3
dosfstools
```

Debian/Ubuntu :

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang-12 lld-12 llvm-12 make cmake python3 python3-pip dosfstools
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Your distro may not support llvm-12 yet. Please see [llvm apt](https://apt.llvm.org/) to get the entries for your sources.list

## Building

To build TS/OS, run

```sh
python3 ./build.py <platform>
```

For example, the platform `pc` runs the pc build.

To get the list of supported systems and other options, type `help` as the platform

## Configuring

In the `cfg` directory, some json config files exist. I plan to make them control the entire build process of TS/OS.

## Developing

Look in the `documents` directory for some more information on TS/OS, and also the C++ header files have more information
on TS/OS, and how it is interacting with hardware.
